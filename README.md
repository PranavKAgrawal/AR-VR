Problem statement
AR-Based Shopping App:
The biggest problem with buying furniture is that you have almost no idea how it will actually fit into your interior. This is why people hire visual designers who can show the whole picture. The objective of this AR app is to place any piece of furniture into your house without needing to bring it there physically. IKEA has managed to bring one such augmented reality idea to life when they released their augmented reality application that allows you to do that. It can even scale the furniture and change colours.
